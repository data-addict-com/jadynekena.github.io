Who never heard about AI in 2024 ? Why is it so trendy nowadays ? Why do some companies act like they knew about it for DECADES ?  As a **data professional**, I'm gonna say what I think about it (**and the title says it all**).

# Disclaimer
This article is going to be less technical than usual. The whole content here is a **very personal point of view** and I don't pretend to have the absolute knowledge. Since chatGPT has been publicly launched in November 2022, I noticed a **very disturbing way of how people talk about AI in general**. Let's dive into it.    
> You might ask yourself - and you are totally right to do so : who am I to be a relevant perspective ? Well, I've been **working as a Data Analyst for 6+ years now**, and before that, I have spent 6 years in an engineering school (IT and telecommunications), and I learned how Deep Learning works in 2019 (3 years before it begun to be so trendy). I spent **almost the half of my life dedicated to IT**. And don't get me wrong: **I do use AI frequently** (as long as it can help), but I don't agree with the current hype on it.

# How AI changed our daily lives

## 1. In Real Life
- schools
- vacation
- work (dev + data)
- in faith (fr)


## 2. On social media
### Standard social medias
The following platforms are those I call "standard" ones:
- **Twitter** (I will never call it X)
- **Facebook** 
- **Instagram**
- **TikTok**
- **Youtube**
In ALL of them, you will probably see contents created by AI (without necessarily knowing it): images, videos, texts, and even voice-overs.

But in middle of that, the most **deplorable** content generated by AI must be **the fake news spreading**. The bigger it is, the more people believe in it and click. 

Another intersting fact about those platforms: they intentionally collect users' data to train their own AI models. Yes, every single activity that you might have online is safely stored on purpose.

# What cringes me the most about how people speak about AI
- AI should be a helper, and humans should ALWAYS be the one with the intelligence. Society tends to make it the other way round, and it disturbs me.
