Have you ever wondered what are the **main events** of the countries of this world ? We might know about the world wars, pandemics, baby boom... But let's see how **demographic data** can also reflect the **history of each country** !

# 1. Data source
_[Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-long-run-with-projections?tab=table){:target="blank"}_ produces frequently demographic data for each country / continent / areas of the world. 

This data source separates time in two parts :
- **Historical data**, until 2021
- **Projected data**, from 2022 until 2100

> To know more about how they gather this demographic data, feel free to [check out their documentation](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources){:target="blank"}.

# 2. Data cleaning
When I downloaded the raw csv data, I noticed that the `country` field has few values that should be ignored, as I only want to preview **demographic data on countries level** :   
![Ignored countries](../assets/img/2024-06-23/ignored-areas.png)

So for the rest of the article, the above territories are discarded.
